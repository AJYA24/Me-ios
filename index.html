                   <p>One day, when I was seven years old, I had gone to my friend's house. There, his cousin was solving a rubik's cube. I was wonderstruck! I was amazed at his skill and speed. From then on, I have been learning to solve many different
             cubes and I can solve them very fast now. It is one of my many skills now.</p>

           <p>Yes, that's right. Waveboarding. This incident took place at a store called Decathlon. I happend to notice a board with two wheels. I tried it, but I fell. From then on, I've been trying and trying and finally I succeeded. Now I can
             ride it down a slope on 5 mph without falling.</p>
